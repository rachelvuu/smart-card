export let chrisBio =  `Hey! My name is Christopher Vitalis and I am a first year
 student at the University of Washington’s Information School. I’m majoring 
 in Informatics with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. I have a passion 
 for designing user interfaces that present information both aesthetically and 
 functionally as to give the user an experience that doesn’t leave them confused 
 or frustrated. A quote from Jared Spool that I feel guides my philosophy on design
  is “Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done 
  poorly that we notice it.” In my spare time I enjoy finding new music and analyzing the 
  different roles that non-traditional sounds play within songs. I also enjoy bouldering and finding new boba 
  shops with my friends in search of the perfect tea. `;
