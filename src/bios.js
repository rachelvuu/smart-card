 student at the University of Washington’s Information School. I’m majoring 
 in Informatics with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. In my spare time I
  enjoy finding new music and analyzing the different roles that non-traditional 
  sounds play within songs. I also enjoy bouldering and finding new boba 
  shops with my friends in search of the perfect tea. `;
